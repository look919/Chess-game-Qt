My biggest project so far and also last using C++ and Qt Creator. It took me around 2 months. Game is fully functional, includes pinning figures, en passant move, discover and double checks. I must admit that i found several bugs in the game but i decided not to dive into this project anymore, in order to focus on Web developing.

Qt Creator required to run this app, created at version 4.8.1.
